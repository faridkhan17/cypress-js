Test Scenarios:
  Automated Test scenarios are defined according the User Stories given in the task. Partially completed survey doesn't update the 
  dashboard so the last assertion is commented out in order to pass the test. 

Project:
  Playwright is used for the project with Typescript. Code can be improved with implementation of Page object model and function 
  for repeatative tasks. So, it is not a clean code. It is implemented just for the demonstration.

Observations:
  - Partial completion of survey doesn't update in the dashboard
  - Label color chart: colors are incorrectly assigned 
  - During survey if someone doesn't want to answer a question or want to skip it, the survey can not be proceeded
